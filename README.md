Sauros is an interpreted language based on list execution, and under heavy development. 

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/bosley/sauros/wiki) to see what has been implemented so far!

The goal of Sauros is to have an easy to use lisp-like scripting language with updated terminiology and features. 
There is a distant hope of having sauros also be compiled, but that will held off until a VM and feature lock is established in a base implementation.
